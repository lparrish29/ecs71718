                <h4>General Information</h4>
                <p>Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder where the body is unable to process certain amino acids properly. MSUD gets its name from the distinct odor of urine of individuals who have been affected. It is an amino acid disorder, and is found in all countries of the world with 1 out of 185,000 newborns being affected.</p>

                <h4>Affected Chromosome</h4>
                <p>MSUD can occure on three different chromosomes at different locations; chromosome 9 at location q13, chromosome 6 at q14, and chromosome 1 at p21. These genes cause little to no enzyme activity to occur in the body. When there is little to no enzyme activity, the disease is classified as "Classic MSUD", which is its most common and severe form. Organic acids that are not broken down by enzymes cause the maple syrup smell.</p>

                <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Symptoms for MSUD can be observed within two to three days of birth. The most noticeable sign of this is the maple syrup smell of urine, which gives this disease its name. An infant begins to experience neurologic signs of distress which include athetoid, where the brain doesn't develop correctly, and hypertonia, where muscles become rigid, and are even tensed while resting. Central neurologic and respiratory functions fail, which leads to the death of the infant.</p>

                <h4>Possible Treatments</h4>
                <p>There are three kinds of tests to deter,ine if someone has MSUD, which include plasma amino acid tests, urine organic acid tests, and genetic testing. If any of these reveal a build up of ketones and excess acid in the blood, the patient has MSUD. Eating a protein-free diet can help treat this disease, and those affected usually require an IV to give them sugars, fluids, and fats. People with this condition must have low amino acid diets for all of their lives.</p>
